# 18NoSQL-socialNetwork

# Social Network API

## Overview

This project involves the development of an API for a social network web application, allowing users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friend list. The application utilizes Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides a flexible, scalable, and high-performance solution for storing and managing data.

- **Mongoose**: An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js that facilitates the interaction with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution and additional features.

- **JavaScript Date Library (optional)**: Optionally, you can use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
